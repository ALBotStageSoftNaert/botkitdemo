# Botkit Anywhere Web Client

Included in this project is a web-based chat client for use with Botkit Anywhere's built-in chat service. This client is built with HTML, CSS and Javascript. It is our hope that it will be easy to customize both the design and the functionality of the chat client with minimal effort.
